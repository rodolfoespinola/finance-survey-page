## What I Learned

- Structuring forms semantically using appropriate HTML tags like `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>`.
- The importance of code review for identifying and correcting errors and improving structure.
- Grouping related form elements using `<fieldset>` and providing context with `<legend>` for better organization and accessibility.
- Ensuring proper association between labels and form controls using the `for` attribute and matching `id`.
- Understanding the distinct behavior and use cases of radio buttons (single selection) and checkboxes (multiple selections).

## Next Steps

- Continue progressing through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- Explore tools like GitHub Desktop, GitHub Pages, and Vercel for version control and deployment.
- Consider creating an account on Frontend Mentor to practice front-end development skills with design challenges.

## Setup

To view the survey form locally:

1.  Clone the repository containing the `[nome-do-seu-arquivo-html].html` file (e.g., `survey-form.html`). If you haven't created a repository yet, you can simply save your HTML file locally.
2.  Open the `[nome-do-seu-arquivo-html].html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by using the "Open File" option in your browser. Alternatively, you can use a Live Server extension in your code editor (like VS Code) for automatic reloading during development.
